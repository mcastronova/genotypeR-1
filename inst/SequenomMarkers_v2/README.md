# Genotype Markers

Pipeline to design genotype markers. This was built to design markers for the Sequenom and GoldenGate platforms. This pipeline requires VCFtools v0.1.14+.

If there is one population file, use the scripts provided in the [pop_sample](https://github.com/StevisonLab/genotypeR/tree/master/inst/SequenomMarkers_v2/pop_sample) folder.

If there are two vcf files, use the scripts provided in the [two_sample](https://github.com/StevisonLab/genotypeR/tree/master/inst/SequenomMarkers_v2/two_sample) folder.
